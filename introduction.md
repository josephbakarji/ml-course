At some point in history, humans learned how to quantify the world: to transform the nuanced and high-dimensional world we experience into numbers. 
Anthropological accounts for earliest instance for humans counting objects come from the Paleolithic age, when each tally mark stood for a "one" and each fifth mark scored through to keep track of the number. At the time not much was counted and thus larger number were probably not needed; or their power was probably not appreciated. 
Much later, Egyptians were known to develop symbols for numbers; for example, a coiled rope represented 100 and a water lily represented a thousand. This made it easier for larger numbers to be counted.

It's hard to say when humans realized that certain ways of quantifying the world give rise to very predictable patterns, and there isn't a unique way of telling the story.
Indeed, non-uniqueness doesn't only show up in how we tell the human story of intelligence and evolution, but also in science, and machine learning.
Here's one way of telling the story:

Only a few centuries ago, we discovered that some physical systems that we quantify follow simple mathematical patterns. 
In 1581, it is said that Galileo was attending Mass in Pisa and noticed a chaldelier swinging over his head in the Cathedral. 
As the air currents coming from window grew stronger, the amplitudes of the swings became larger. 
Being a curious scientist who enjoys finding patterns, Galileo noticed that the period it took for the chandelier to swing back and forth is independent of the amplitude.

The idea of quantifying different aspects of a physical system and then finding the relationship between them started a revolution in how we understand the physical world and spread throughout Europe.  

Discovering physical laws was a combination of a well-designed experiement where a controlled measurable quantity 'causes' another measurable quantity to change, and a simple linear fit of those quantities where the propoertionality constant is given a physical meaning. Here are just a few examples:

- Pascal's Law (1653): $\Delta p = \rho g \Delta h$
- Hooke's law (1678): $F = - k x$
- Newton's law of viscosity (1701): $ \tau = \mu \frac{du}{dy}$
- Ohm's law (1781): $I = V/R$
- Fourier's law (1822): $q = -k \frac{dT}{dx}$
- Fick's law (1855): $J = -D \frac{dC}{dx}$
- Darcy's law (1856): $q = -\frac{k}{\mu L} \Delta p$

The origins of the ideal gas law, $PV = k_B NT$, (1834) are particularly interesting since they are the result of a combination of linear laws discovered over 2 centuries:

- Boyle's law (1662): $P ~ V$
- Charles' law (1787): $T ~ V$
- Amonton's law (1808): $P ~ T$
- Avogadro's law (1811): $N ~ V$
