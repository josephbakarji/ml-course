    "### Course description\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is everwhere around you, and it's starting to redefine the process of scientific discovery. This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning methods with applications in science and engineering. Topics include: supervised learning (linear/logistic regression, neural networks, support vector machines etc.), unsupervised learning (clustering, PCA, autoencoders), reinforcement learning, and learning theory (variance/bias trade-off, approximation/estimation errors, etc.). The course will emphasize engineering and scientific applications, including: control theory, nonlinear dynamics, fluid dynamics, and materials science. Recent developments in physics-informed machine learning techniques will be discussed, including: sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs).\n",
